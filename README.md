# Smart-Traffic-Signaling-System-Using-Arduino
Metropolitan traffic control system using IOT techniques 

#Abstract:
The project is designed to develop a density based dynamic traffic signal system. The signal
timing changes automatically on sensing the traffic density at the junction. Traffic congestion is
a severe problem in many major cities across the world and it has become a nightmare for the
commuters in these cities. Conventional traffic light system is based on fixed time concept
allotted to each side of the junction which cannot be varied as per varying traffic density.
Junction timings allotted are fixed. Sometimes higher traffic density at one side of the junction
demands longer green time as compared to standard allotted time. The image captured in the
traffic signal is processed and converted into grayscale image then its threshold is calculated
based on which the contour has been drawn in order to calculate the number of vehicles present
in the image. After calculating the number of vehicles we will came to know in which side the
density is high based on which signals will be allotted for a particular side. Raspberry pi is used
as a microcontroller which provides the signal timing based on the traffic density. Traffic is
increasing in proportion to the population especially in a developing country like India. Hence
there is a great need to have a well coordination of the traffic signals for the smooth control of
traffic especially in busy traffic hours. Traffic congestion monitoring and controlling is one of
the biggest challenges in many cities and this may affect the environmental life and disturbs our
daily life routine. Due to increasing population, the number of roads and vehicles has
considerably increased which have created many problems such as travel time delay, fuel
wastage, air pollution and transport related issues. The main aim of the invention is to reduce
traffic congestion in cities. Many sensors have been selected for this purpose like IR sensors,
Ultrasonic sensors but at the end we chose IR sensors because of the efficiency of the IR sensors.
These sensors are used to detect the distance between the vehicles and hence can be used for an
automatic traffic signaling system which can lay the foundation in the construction of a Smart
city.
