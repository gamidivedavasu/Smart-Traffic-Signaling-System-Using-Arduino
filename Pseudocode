Procedure Traffic_Control_System()
1. Start
2. Check whether the vehicle is Emergency vehicle or not.
3. If the vehicle is an Emergency vehicle then note down the LCD screen number of that
vehicle and display an LED.
4. Else for an ordinary vehicle check the distance of the vehicle from the traffic signal
using an IR sensor.
5. The distance value is then compared with the values generated by other IR sensors.
6. The sensor which has generated least value indicates that traffic is nearer to them and
hence is given priority.
7. The topmost priority sensor then initiates the Arduino board to glow a Green led so
that the traffic can go smoothly and hence reduces traffic congestion.
8. A yellow led and a red led glows automatically after the glowing of the green led.
9. The whole process is repeated again and again until the power is off.
10. Stop
